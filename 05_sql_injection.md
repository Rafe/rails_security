##SQL injection

In Rails, all database access is going through ActiveRecords, which is the Rails's ORM model. The ORM code is automatically generated by Rails according to the database schema and mapping the database Table. So Most of the database interaction is pre-defined in the ActiveRecords. 

For example:

	# "SELECT id,name FROM User where id=?" is mapped in ActiveRecord by:	@user = User.find(param[:id])
So SQL injection is not a big problem since it's hard to inject SQL code.
However, there are still some condition that might use the SQL code like search:
	User.find(:first, :condition => 
		"login = '#{params[:name]}' AND password = '#{params[:password]}'")

If user enter username as "user ' OR 1=1"  
and password as "password = '' OR '1'= '1'". the result SQL will become:

	SELECT * FROM users WHERE login = '' OR '1'='1' AND password = '' OR '2'>'1' LIMIT 1

And it will return the first record in the database and get access to that user.

But Rails also has a built-in filter for special SQL character like quote, comment and line break. And it will apply to the method like find , find_by_parameter. but need to applied manually in :condition block:

	User.find(:first, :conditions =>[ "login = ? AND password = ?", username,password ])
